Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_startups data.
Do transformations for getting better predictions of profit and
make a table containing R^2 value for each prepared model.

pandas is used for data manipulation,cleaning and analysis.
numpy is used for scientific calculations.
describe() is used to know some statistical caluculations like mean,count,std,min,max.

seaborn library-it is used to give more attractive and informative representations of the diagrams.

seaborn.pairplot()-pairplot is a grid of plots for each variable in the dataset.

iloc is used to represent the require data by selecting the rows and columns.
it is also used to select the require data from the dataset and  drop the empty data .


statsmodel.formula.api-used for doing statistical calculations

vif-variance inflation factor=>vif>10 =>multiple collinearity

sklearn.model_selection- spilt arrays and matrices in random train and test datasets.

train_test_split=it is a function in sklearn.model_selection for splitting data arrays into two subsets :for testing data and traing data. 

multi collinearity:when one variable predicts other it is called multi collinearity.
